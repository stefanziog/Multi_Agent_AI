This readme describes how to use the included Java searchclient with the server that is contained in server.jar.

The search client requires at least a JDK for Java 11, and has been tested with OpenJDK.

Note that if you have the CLASSPATH environment variable set, the following commands may/will fail.
You should not have the CLASSPATH environment variable set unless you know what you're doing.

All the following commands assume the working directory is the one this readme is located in.

You can read about the server options using the -h argument:
    $ java -jar ../server.jar -h

Compiling the searchclient:
    $ javac searchclient/*.java

Starting the server using the searchclient:
    $ java -jar ../server.jar -l ../levels/SAD1.lvl -c "java searchclient.SearchClient" -g -s 150 -t 180

The searchclient uses the BFS strategy by default. Use arguments -dfs, -astar, -wastar, or -greedy to set alternative search strategies (after you implement them). For instance, to use DFS on the same level as above:
    $ java -jar ../server.jar -l ../levels/SAD1.lvl -c "java searchclient.SearchClient -dfs" -g -s 150 -t 180

Memory settings:
    * Unless your hardware is unable to support this, you should let the JVM allocate at least 4GB of memory for the searchclient *
    Your JVM determines how much memory a program is allowed to allocate. These settings can be manipulated by certain VM options.
    The -Xmx option sets the maximum size of the heap, i.e. how much memory your program can allocate.
    The -Xms option sets the initial size of the heap.
    To set the max heap size to 4GB:
        $ java -jar ../server.jar -l ../levels/SAD1.lvl -c "java -Xmx4g searchclient.SearchClient" -g -s 150 -t 180
    Note that this option is set for the *client*.
    Avoid setting max heap size too high, since it will lead to your OS doing memory swapping which is terribly slow.


Navigate from cmd to AIMA and check various implementations with the following :

 
java -jar server.jar -l complevels/SALTY.lvl -c "java searchclient.Salty -astar to set the search strategy" -g -s 150 -t 180
